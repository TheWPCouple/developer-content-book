# Title Length

"How long should your post title be?" is quite a debate since some of you write long titles while many others will advocate writing short titles.

But, do you know that Google starts cutting titles in its SERPs (search engine result pages) after 50-60 characters?

It means that you should try writing short post titles preferably between *five* to *eight* words. I try my best to limit the titles under five words.

Moreover, short titles are **indexed better**, convey a more **targeted message** and are **easier to read**. I would recommend writing long titles for more casual content or when it is utterly needed.

Several Google SERP preview tools are available. These help you write and analyze engaging post titles.
