# Titled-Cased titles

**Title-cased headings** show authority and importance. Every time I need my post titles to stand out as important I use title-cased headings.

Title-cased headings draw *attention* and provide *emphasis*. However, you generally find it difficult to figure out what to capitalize.

Mostly, you capitalize the *first* letter of every word. This is kind of OK but lots of capitalization reduces legibility. Learning the right way of capitalization is important yet it is hard if you try memorizing it.

## Tools for Title-Casing

There are several free online tools that help you write title-cased headings for your content.

- I use the **[TitleCase It!](https://titlecaseit.ahmadawais.com/)** toolkit by [Ahmad Awais](https://ahmadawais.com/about/).
- Other good options include [Title Case Converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com/) and [TitleCase](https://titlecase.com/).
